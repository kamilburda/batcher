## Known Issues

Sometimes, after you press the Export button, it may seem as though nothing happens.
In that case, the file format dialog may be displayed behind GIMP. If so, simply select the dialog to bring it up.

The following file formats require displaying the file format dialog for each image to be exported, not just the first image:
* C source,
* HTML.

On Windows, exporting with the following file formats does not work properly if file paths contain accented (Unicode) characters:
* X PixMap Image.

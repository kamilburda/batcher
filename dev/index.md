## What can Batcher do?

* Export images to any file format provided by GIMP and third-party plug-ins
* Apply arbitrary procedures during batch processing (rename, scale, insert background, filters, ...)
* Apply constraints to restrict the images/layers to process (only images matching a filename suffix, only visible layers, ...)

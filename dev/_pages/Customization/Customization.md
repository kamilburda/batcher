Beyond the basic features, Batcher allows you to:
* [adjust image/layer names](Renaming.md),
* apply [actions](Actions.md) to each image/layer (scale down, insert background, layer effects, GIMP plug-ins, ...) during batch processing,
* filter image/layers by applying [conditions](Conditions.md) (only filenames matching a suffix, only visible layers, ...).

As the amount of customization may be overwhelming at first, you may want to take a look at a few [examples](../Examples.md) to get started.

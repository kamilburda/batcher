## Requirements

* GIMP 2.99.18 (will **not** work in earlier or later versions)
* Python 3.7 or higher


## Windows

1. Make sure you have GIMP installed with support for Python scripting.
2. Locate the folder containing GIMP plug-ins - open GIMP and go to `Edit → Preferences → Folders → Plug-Ins`.
3. Extract the `batcher` folder from the downloaded archive to one of the folders chosen in the previous step.


## Linux

An easy way to install any Python-based GIMP plug-in is to use a GIMP installation bundled in Flatpak (which can be downloaded from the [official GIMP page](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/devel/)) or AppImage.

1. Make sure you have Python 3.7 installed.
2. Locate the folder containing GIMP plug-ins - open GIMP and go to `Edit → Preferences → Folders → Plug-Ins`. If you cannot locate any of the folders on your system, you can add a custom folder.

<!-- end of summary -->

**New major feature: Export of images opened in GIMP**. You can perform image export via `File → Export Images...` or `File → Export Images (Quick)`. As with other plug-in procedures, you may make use of procedures and constraints (such as "only images with unsaved changes"). Note that this feature exports images to another file format, i.e. it does not mass-save XCF images in their original locations.

General changes:
* When exporting each image/layer individually, layers are no longer automatically merged into one. This allows preserving layers when exporting to a multi-layer format such as PSD.
* Batch Convert is now guaranteed to be accessible in GIMP even if no image is opened.

Changes to procedures:
* The `Rename` procedure is now automatically renamed based on the specified pattern (e.g. `Rename to "image[001]"`).

Bug fixes:
* Fixed a crash on startup for macOS installation packages.
* Fixed a crash in non-interactive mode if the settings file is not specified.
* Fixed a warning message displayed when exporting or editing layers of an imported (i.e. non-XCF) image.
* Fixed console warnings when opening the custom procedure browser.

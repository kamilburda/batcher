<!-- end of summary -->

User interface changes:
* Dialogs for editing procedures, constraints and export settings are now scrollable if exceeding a certain height. Some custom procedures (e.g. `gegl:styles`) and file formats (e.g. DDS) have a large number of parameters, which previously made the dialogs too high to fit the screen.
* Increased the minimum width of labels in dialogs. This makes particularly the procedure browser dialog more readable.

Bug fixes:
* Fixed visually unappealing borders in the custom procedure browser appearing when switching to a procedure requiring scrolling.
* For Export Layers, fixed the wrong name for the `Cancel`/`Close` button on plug-in startup if `Close When Done` is unchecked.

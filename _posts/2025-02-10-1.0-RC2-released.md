<!-- end of summary -->

General changes:
* Updated Batcher to work with GIMP 3.0.0-RC3. **Due to backwards-incompatible changes, Batcher now requires GIMP 3.0.0-RC3 or later**. Saved settings from previous versions will still work properly.
* You can now choose `None` for image and layer arguments in custom procedures if a procedure allows omitting them.
* More appropriate GUI is displayed for settings and procedure arguments representing files or folders. You can also choose to omit these arguments if a procedure allows omitting them.
* For `Gimp.Unit` procedure arguments, the pixel and/or percentage units are not shown if a procedure is set to hide them.

Bug fixes:
* Fixed settings from version 0.8 not being updated to 1.0-RC1 and later.
* Fixed a potential bug where arrays of images, layers and other GIMP objects as procedure or constraint arguments could not be edited.

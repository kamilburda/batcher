<!-- end of summary -->

* Updated Batcher to work with GIMP 3.0.0-RC1. **Batcher now requires GIMP 3.0.0-RC1 or later.** Earlier development versions of GIMP (2.99.x) will not work. Any future GIMP 3.x version will work unless stated otherwise.
* Greatly optimized the preview when changing selection. The performance drop was noticeable for hundreds of items.
* Fixed several bugs related to the preview when the selected item is changed.
* Fixed `Insert background` and `Insert foreground` procedures inserting group layers twice.
* Fixed occasional GIMP error messages when batch processing is finished.
